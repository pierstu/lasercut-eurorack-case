# lasercut-eurorack-case
Lasercut eurorack case for 427mm and 432mm rails, fork of the [NLC sketch for a 93mm deep case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1205913/files) to embed the [MMI Usb Power](https://pushermanproductions.com/product/mmi-modular-usb-power-supply/). I chose to use 10mm plywood. 
# why are there two lengths?
Because my local shop sells 432mm long rails, which is 5mm wider than the 427mm you can get at Synthracks. There are drawings for both lengths. Don't get the vector ones, use the other type (the ones with a lid on the external side).
