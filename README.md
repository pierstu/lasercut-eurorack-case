# lasercut-eurorack-case
Lasercut eurorack case for 427mm and 432mm rails, fork of the [NLC sketch for a 93mm deep case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1205913/files) to embed the [MMI Usb Power](https://pushermanproductions.com/product/mmi-modular-usb-power-supply/), which has a 3mm offset in depth, suitable for low profile M3 hex nuts. I chose to use 10mm plywood. Pre-drills fit M3 or M3.5 screws.
# why are there two lengths?
Because my local shop sells 432mm long rails, which is 5mm wider than the 427mm you can get at Synthracks. There are drawings for both lengths. Don't get the vector ones, use the other type (the ones with a lip on the external side). 
# todo
- removable lid ? still have to find a correct ratio between the _minimum utile_ to keep a patch on the go, and the average depth of my backpacks (since the final aim is to play outside, with no wall wart)
- a handle,
- corner protections,
- foldable desktop stand ?
